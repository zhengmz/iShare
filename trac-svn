# Setup in trac.ini
1. enable component to support subversion:

[components]
tracopt.versioncontrol.svn.* = enabled

2. Specifying repositories

   a) A repository name and one of alias or dir attributes are mandatory. All others are optional.

[repositories]
main.dir = /opt/svn/svntest
main.description = This is the ''main'' project repository.
main.type = svn
main.url = http://localhost/svn/svntest
main.hidden = true

lib.dir = /opt/svn/svnlib
lib.description = This is the secondary library code.
lib.type = svn
lib.url = http://localhost/svn/svnlib

.alias = main

   b) After adding a repository, the cache for that repository must be re-synchronized once with the trac-admin $ENV repository resync command.

    trac-admin /opt/trac/svnproj repository resync *

3. Repository synchronization
   a) Set the [trac] repository_sync_per_request option to an empty value to disable per-request syncing
   b) adding a call to trac-admin in the post-commit hook of each repository

#!/bin/sh
export PYTHON_EGG_CACHE="/opt/trac/.egg-cache"
/usr/bin/trac-admin /opt/trac/svnproj changeset added "$1" "$2"

4. Migration from a single-repository setup (Subversion)

   a) Remove the default repository specification from the [trac] repository_dir option.
   b) Add the main repository as a named repository.
   c) Re-synchronize the main repository.
   d) Set up post-commit and post-revprop-change hooks on the "main" repository, and set [trac] repository_sync_per_request to an empty value.
   e) Add an alias to the main repository as the default repository (by leaving out the the name, e.g. .alias = main). This ensures that all links predating the migration still resolve to the main repository.
   f) Repeat steps 2, 3 and 4 to add other "named" repositories as needed.
